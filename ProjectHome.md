**Project not maintained anymore please consider using [TikzEdt](http://code.google.com/p/tikzedt/) instead.**


It is a graphical editor for graphs (as in graph theory).
It can be thought of as the Drawing-Tool analogue of LyX.

Features:
  * Generates "relatively clean" Tikz code.
  * Real time preview of tex output (requires latex and mupdf)
  * Real time preview of formulas like in preview-latex (requires latex and dvipng)
  * Parses Tikz code. (The parser is written using the Antlr parser generator.)
  * supports cartesian/polar coordinates
  * Supports styles and includes a style repository to create consistent layouts among multiple graphs
